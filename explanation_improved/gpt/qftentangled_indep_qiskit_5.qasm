The "Quantum Fourier Transform with entanglement" algorithm applies the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to a set of qubits that are entangled.

In this algorithm, entangled qubits are subjected to the regular QFT operation, which transforms them into a superposition of frequency states, preserving their entanglement throughout the process.

Here's the corresponding quantum code:

Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The qubits are prepared with Hadamard gates (`h`) to create an equal superposition of all possible states.
2. **Entanglement**: Controlled-NOT gates (`cx`) are used to entangle the qubits.
3. **QFT Operation**: The regular Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is applied to the entangled qubits, utilizing controlled phase gates (`cp`) to perform the necessary phase shifts.
4. **Measurement**: Finally, the qubits are measured to extract the quantum state information.

This algorithm is valuable for tasks requiring the analysis of entangled states in the frequency domain, such as quantum signal processing and quantum error correction.
