Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental quantum algorithm used to estimate the phase of a quantum operation. It serves as a critical component in many quantum algorithms, particularly in tasks involving phase estimation and quantum state preparation.

In QPE, a quantum circuit is designed to estimate the phase angle of a given quantum state transformation. The accuracy of the estimation depends on the number of qubits used in the estimation register. In the exact case, the phase applied is exactly representable by the number of qubits used in the estimation process.

Here's the corresponding quantum code:

Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The qubits in the estimation register are prepared in a superposition state using Hadamard gates (`h`).
2. **Phase Application**: The quantum operation phase is applied to the state `psi[0]` using controlled-phase gates (`cp`).
3. **Quantum Circuit**: The quantum circuit manipulates the qubits to encode the phase information into the state of the estimation register.
4. **Measurement**: Finally, the qubits in the estimation register are measured to obtain the estimated phase angle.

Quantum Phase Estimation is a foundational algorithm in quantum computing, playing a crucial role in various quantum algorithms and protocols, including quantum factorization and quantum simulation.
