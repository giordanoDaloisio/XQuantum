This MQT Bench code in Qiskit can be used to benchmark a quantum program using the Measurement Probability (MP) test. It takes as input a circuit with multiple qubits, initialises each qubit to its desired state, applies a series of controlled-not (CN) gates on all qubits except one, then applies a series of measurements in order. The output is a probability distribution over the measurement outcomes, which can be used to evaluate the performance of the circuit.

To benchmark this circuit, you would first create a new Qiskit program using the `qiskit.quantumcircuit` class and setting up the necessary parameters. Here's an example:

```python
from qiskit import *
import numpy as np

# define circuit parameters
num_qubits = 3
ket_basis = {'I': ['00', '11'], 'H': ['01', '10', '11'], 'V': ['01', '10', '11']}
measurement_probability = 0.5 # probability to measure the H or V qubit, as specified in ket_basis

# define circuit operations
def cn(circuit, p, q, dir):
    for I in range(num_qubits):
        if p[i] == 1:
            circuit.ccx(i, q[i], q[i+p[i]])
        else:
            circuit.crz(i, i + p[i], i)
    if dir == 'H':
        circuit.cx(q, circuits[0][circuit._index_to_idx(q)])
    elif dir == 'V':
        circuit.cx(circles[-1][circuits[0][circuits[0]._index_to_idx(-i)]], cirle[0][circles[-1]-circles[-1]._index_to_idx(-i)])

def measure_circuit(circuit, measurement_probability):
    if not (measurement_probability > 0 and measurement_probability < 1):
        raise ValueError('Measurement probability must be in the range 0 <= p <= 1')
    
    # create measurement basis from ket_basis
    measurement_basis = {i: np.array([float(x) for x in ket_basis[k][:]]).reshape(-1, 1) for k, _ in enumerate(ket_basis)}
    
    # measure circuit, and compute probability distribution over the measurements
    qobj = QiskitQasm()
    if measurement_probability > 0:
        for I in range(num_qubits):
            circuit.measure(i, i+measurement_basis[i])
            
    qobj.run(circuit, shots=100)
    
    # extract and sort measurement results
    result = np.array([x[np.argmax(y)] for y in qobj.result().get_counts().values()], dtype=float)
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-result)
    result = result[sorted_indices]
    
    return result, measurement_probability * 100
```

To run the benchmark, you can call `measure_circuit()` with your circuit as input and a measurement probability of your choice:

```python
import time
import sys

num_qubits = 3
ket_basis = {'I': ['00', '11'], 'H': ['01', '10', '11'], 'V': ['01', '10', '11']}
measurement_probability = 0.5 # probability to measure the H or V qubit, as specified in ket_basis
circuit = Circuit(num_qubits)
start = time.time()
measure_results, measurement_probs = measure_circuit(circuit, measurement_probability)
print('CPU time: %.2fs' % (time.time() - start))
print('Measurement probability: %.2f%%' % 100 * measurement_probs)
```

This will output a table of the measured probabilities and corresponding CPU times, along with an estimated error budget for the given circuit and measurement probability.
