Please provide a detailed explanation of the quantum circuit shown below, including a general description of what is happening, a high-level description of each step, and a relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code line. The circuit is implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which is a simple quantum algorithm that factorizes integers.

General Description: The circuit starts by defining a quantum register `q` with 10 cubits (quantum bits) and a classical register `c` with 9 elements. It then applies various gates (Hadamard, CNOT, barrier) to evolve the state of the qubits and measure the resulting states to obtain the classical outputs.

High-Level Description:

1. The circuit starts by defining the quantum register `q` and the classical register `c`.
2. The Hadamard gate is applied to qubits 2 and 4, which creates a superposition of both qubits being in the |0⟩ state and the |1⟩ state simultaneously.
3. A controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is applied between qubits 0 and 9, followed by a barrier to ensure that the computation proceeds in a single thread. The CNOT gate swaps the state of qubit 0 with the state of qubit 9, depending on whether the control qubit is |0⟩ or |1⟩.
4. The barrier is applied again to ensure that the computation proceeds in a single thread.
5. Measurements are performed on each qubit in the quantum register `q`, which produces classical outputs in the classical register `c`.

Relation with Code Line: Each high-level step can be related to a specific code line as follows:

* The Hadamard gate is applied in line 3.
* The CNOT gate is applied in lines 7 and 10.
* The barrier is applied in lines 8 and 12.
* Measurements are performed in line 14.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-17
