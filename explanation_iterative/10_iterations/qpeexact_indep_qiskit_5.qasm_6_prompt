Please provide an explanation of how the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm works, using the following high-level steps to guide your explanation:

1. A general description of what's happening: Explain that the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is used to simulate the time-evolution of a quantum system under the influence of a Hamiltonian.
2. A high-level description of each step: Provide a brief explanation of each step in the quantum circuit, including the CP gates, barrier gate, and measurements.
3. A relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code lines: Explain how each step in the quantum circuit corresponds to a specific line of code in the OpenQASM program.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-18
