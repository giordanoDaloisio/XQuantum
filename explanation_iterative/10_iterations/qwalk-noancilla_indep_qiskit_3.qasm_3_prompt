Please provide an explanation of the quantum circuit shown below, including a general description of what's happening, a high-level description of each step, and a relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code line. The circuit implements a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, where the position of the walker is represented by a qubit.

General Description: The quantum circuit simulates a random walk on a one-dimensional lattice, where the position of the walker is evolved through a series of quantum gates. The walker's position is represented by a qubit, which is manipulated through a sequence of CX, bit flip, and U2 rotation gates. The algorithm repeats these steps multiple times, resulting in a superposition of different quantum walks. After the final application of the barrier, the measurement outcomes are read from the classical registers to obtain the statistics of the quantum walk.

High-Level Steps:

1. `OPENQASM 2.0`: This line indicates the beginning of the quantum circuit.
2. `qubit[0]`: This line defines the qubit that represents the position of the walker.
3. `CX gate interleaved with bit flip gates and U2 rotation gates`: This line describes the sequence of quantum gates that are applied to the qubit. The CX gates are used to manipulate the phase of the walker's position, while the bit flip gates are used to randomize the position of the walker. The U2 rotation gates are used to rotate the state of the walker by 90 degrees in the complex plane.
4. `barrier`: This line implements a barrier that prevents the quantum walk from evolving further until the measurement is performed.
5. `measurement outcomes stored in classical registers`: This line describes the outcome of the measurement, which are stored in the classical registers `meas`.

Relation to Code Line: Each high-level step can be related to a specific code line in the following way:

* `OPENQASM 2.0`: This line corresponds to the beginning of the quantum circuit, and it indicates that the algorithm is starting to evolve the walker's position through the sequence of quantum gates.
* `qubit[0]`: This line defines the qubit that represents the position of the walker, and it is used as the input for the subsequent quantum gates.
* `CX gate interleaved with bit flip gates and U2 rotation gates`: This line describes the sequence of quantum gates that are applied to the qubit. Each gate has a specific function: the CX gates manipulate the phase of the walker's position, while the bit flip gates randomize the position of the walker, and the U2 rotation gates rotate the state of the walker by 90 degrees in the complex plane.
* `barrier`: This line implements a barrier that prevents the quantum walk from evolving further until the measurement is performed. It marks the end of the algorithm and the beginning of the measurement process.
* `measurement outcomes stored in classical registers`: This line describes the outcome of the measurement, which are stored in the classical registers `meas`. It indicates that the measurement has been performed and the results are available for analysis.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-19
