This is a quantum circuit written in Qiskit's OPENQASM format. The circuit implements a quantum walk algorithm on a 1D lattice, with three cubits (qubits) and several measurements. Here's a high-level explanation of the code:

1. `OPENQASM 2.0`: This line specifies that the code is written in OPENQASM version 2.0.
2. `include "qelib1.inc"`: This line includes the QELIB1 library, which provides various utility functions for quantum circuits.
3. `qreg node[2];`: This line defines two qubits, denoted by `node[0]` and `node[1]`.
4. `qreg coin[1];`: This line defines a single qubit denoted by `coin[0]`.
5. `creg meas[3];`: This line defines three classical registers denoted by `meas[0]`, `meas[1]`, and `meas[2]`.
6. `h coin[0];`: This line applies a Hadamard gate to the single qubit `coin[0]`.
7. `ccx coin[0],node[1],node[0];`: This line applies a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[1]`, and then applies a CNOT gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[0]`.
8. `cx coin[0],node[1];`: This line applies a controlled-X (CX) gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[1]`.
9. `x node[1];`: This line applies a bit flip operation on the qubit `node[1]`.
10. `x coin[0];`: This line applies a bit flip operation on the qubit `coin[0]`.
11. `ccx coin[0],node[1],node[0];`: This line applies a CNOT gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[1]`, and then applies a CNOT gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[0]`.
12. `cx coin[0],node[1];`: This line applies a CX gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[1]`.
13. `x node[1];`: This line applies a bit flip operation on the qubit `node[1]`.
14. `u2(-pi,-pi) coin[0];`: This line applies a U2 rotation gate to the qubit `coin[0]` with an argument of `-pi` in both the real and imaginary parts.
15. `ccx coin[0],node[1],node[0];`: This line applies a CNOT gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[1]`, and then applies a CNOT gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[0]`.
16. `cx coin[0],node[1];`: This line applies a CX gate between the qubits `coin[0]` and `node[1]`.
17. `x node[1];`: This line applies a bit flip operation on the qubit `node[1]`.
18. `barrier node[0],node[1],coin[0];`: This line applies a barrier gate to the cubits `node[0]`, `node[1]`, and `coin[0]`. This ensures that the quantum walk algorithm terminates after a fixed number of steps.
19. `measure node[0] -> meas[0];`: This line measures the state of the cubit `node[0]` in the register `meas[0]`.
20. `measure node[1] -> meas[1];`: This line measures the state of the cubit `node[1]` in the register `meas[1]`.
21. `measure coin[0] -> meas[2];`: This line measures the state of the single qubit `coin[0]` in the register `meas[2]`.

The quantum walk algorithm implemented in this code consists of a series of CNOT and CX gates between the cubits and the single qubit, followed by a barrier gate to terminate the algorithm. The measurements are applied at the end of the algorithm to extract the results of the quantum walk.
