Please provide an explanation of the quantum circuit shown below, including a general description of what's happening, a high-level description of each step, and a relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code line. The circuit is designed to simulate a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, and it includes 3 cubits labeled node[0], node[1], and coin[0].

General Description: The circuit simulates a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, where the position of the walker is represented by the cubits. The CX gates are used to evolve the quantum state, and the barrier is used to freeze the state at the end of the evolution. The measurement outcomes are stored in the `meas` classical registers.

High-Level Steps:

1. `OPENQASM 2.0`: This line specifies that the circuit is written in OPENQASM version 2.0, which is a quantum circuit language for programming quantum computers.
