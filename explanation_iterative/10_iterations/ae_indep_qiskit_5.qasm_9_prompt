The quantum circuit algorithm is a method for measuring the amplitude of a target state in a quantum system. The algorithm works by creating multiple copies of the target state and applying unitary transformations to rotate each copy in a different basis. The outcomes of these measurements are then used to calculate the probability distribution over the four states.

Here's a high-level description of each step in the algorithm:

1. Initialize the quantum register `q` with the target state.
2. Create multiple copies of the target state and store them in separate quantum registers.
3. Apply unitary transformations to rotate each copy of the target state in a different basis.
4. Measure the outcome of the measurement of each copy of the target state and store the outcome in a classical register.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to generate a probability distribution over the four states.
6. Use the outcomes of the measurements in the classical registers to calculate the probability distribution over the four states.

In terms of the relevant code lines, the algorithm starts by declaring a quantum register `q` and initialize it with the target state: `creg q[0];` Line 4 defines five classical registers called `meas` that will be used to store the outcome of the measurement of each copy of the target state. Line 15 defines a Hadamard gate on the third quantum register `eval[3]`, which is used to prepare the target state for measurement.

The algorithm then repeats steps 2-6 multiple times, and for each repetition it performs the following steps:

Step 2: Create multiple copies of the target state and store them in separate quantum registers. This is done by declaring a quantum register `q` and using the line `qreg q[1];`.

Step 3: Apply unitary transformations to rotate each copy of the target state in a different basis. This is done by defining a 2x2 unitary matrix using the lines `u2(0, pi) eval[0];` and `u2(0, -pi) eval[1];`.

Step 4: Measure the outcome of the measurement of each copy of the target state and store the outcome in a classical register. This is done by using the line `creg meas[0];`.

Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4 multiple times to generate a probability distribution over the four states.

Overall, the quantum circuit algorithm is a method for measuring the amplitude of a target state in a quantum system by creating multiple copies of the target state and applying unitary transformations to rotate each copy in a different basis. The outcomes of these measurements are then used to calculate the probability distribution over the four states.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-17
