Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching an unsorted database of size $N$. The algorithm works by applying a series of quantum operations to a superposition of states, which amplifies the probability of finding the desired solution in the database.

The high-level steps of the algorithm are:

1. Initialize the qubits in a superposition of states.
2. Apply controlled phase shift and controlled bit flip operations to evolve the state of the qubits.
3. Measure the state of the qubits to determine whether the final state is the desired solution or not.

Each step can be further broken down into more specific details:

1. Initialize the qubits in a superposition of states: This line initializes the qubits in a superposition of states, which means that each qubit is in a linear combination of basis states. The superposition is defined by a complex coefficients, which are determined by the algorithm.
2. Apply controlled phase shift and controlled bit flip operations to evolve the state of the qubits: These operations are applied to the qubits using control gates, which are quantum operations that manipulate the state of the qubits based on the state of an extra qubit (the // Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-19
