Please provide an explanation of the quantum circuit shown below, including a general description of what's happening, a high-level description of each step, and a relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code line. The circuit simulates a quantum walk on a one-dimensional lattice, where the position of the walker is represented by the cubits.

General Description: The circuit implements a quantum walk algorithm on a 1D lattice, with three cubits (qubits) and several measurements. The walker's position is evolved through a series of CNOT and CX gates between the cubits and the single qubit, followed by a barrier gate to terminate the algorithm. The measurements are applied at the end of the algorithm to extract the results of the quantum walk.

High-Level Steps:

1. `OPENQASM 2.0`: This line specifies that the circuit is written in OPENQASM version 2.0, which is a quantum circuit language for programming quantum computers.
