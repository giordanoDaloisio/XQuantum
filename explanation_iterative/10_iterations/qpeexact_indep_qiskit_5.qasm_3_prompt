Please provide an explanation of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm implemented in the code `qpe.py`. Your explanation should include a general description of what's happening in the algorithm, as well as high-level descriptions of each step and their relations to the relevant code lines.

For the general description, you could explain that QPE is a quantum algorithm used to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. The algorithm works by creating a superposition of states on the qubits, applying a series of Hadamard gates to transform the states into a more convenient form, and then measuring each qubit to obtain an estimate of the eigenvalues.

For the high-level descriptions of each step, you could provide the following explanations:

* Step 1: Creating the qubit register `q` and the single qubit register `psi`. This step represents the initial preparation of the quantum state for the algorithm.
* Step 2-4: Applying Hadamard gates to the qubits. These steps represent the transformation of the states into a superposition of states using the Hadamard gates.
* Step .5-8: Applying controlled phase shift operations to the qubits. These steps represent the estimation of the eigenvalues of the unitary operator using the controlled phase shift operations.
* Step 9: Applying the barrier operation to all qubits and the classical register `psi[0]`. This step represents the measurement of each qubit and the storage of the results in a classical register.

In terms of relations between these high-level steps and the relevant code lines, you could explain that the creation of the qubit register `q` and the single qubit register `psi` is represented by line 1, where the algorithm initializes the registers with empty lists. The application of Hadamard gates to the qubits is represented by lines 2-4, where the algorithm applies the Hadamard gates to each qubit in the register `q`. The controlled phase shift operations are represented by lines 5-8, where the algorithm applies the controlled phase shift operations to each qubit in the register `q` using the control qubits in the register `psi`. Finally, the barrier operation is represented by line 9, where the algorithm measures each qubit and stores the results in the classical register `c[0]`.

Overall, this prompt should provide a good starting point for generating an explanation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm implemented in the code `qpe.py`.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-18
