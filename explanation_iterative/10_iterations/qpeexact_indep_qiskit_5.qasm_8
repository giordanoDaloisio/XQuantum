The algorithm performs Quantum Phase Estimation, which is a quantum algorithm used to factorize integers. The circuit starts with a superposition of all possible states of the qubits, and then applies a series of controlled phase shift operations to evolve the state into a fixed point distribution from which the integer to be factored can be extracted. The measurement outcomes correspond to the digits of the factorized integer.
