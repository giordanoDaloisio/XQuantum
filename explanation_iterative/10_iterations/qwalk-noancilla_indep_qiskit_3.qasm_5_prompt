The Quantum Walk algorithm is a simplified example of a quantum algorithm that can be implemented on current quantum hardware. The algorithm simulates a random walk on a one-dimensional lattice, where the position of the walker is encoded in the state of a coin. Each step of the walk consists of a Hadamard gate (step 6) or a controlled phase shift operation (steps 11 and 15), which introduces randomness into the walk. The walker's position is measured at the end of each step (step 18), resulting in a probability distribution over the lattice.

High-level description of each step:

* Step 6: Applies a Hadamard gate to the coin qubit, which randomly sets the state of the coin to either 0 or 1.
* Steps 11 and 15: Performs controlled phase shift operations on the target qubits based on the state of the coin qubit. The phase shift introduces randomness into the walk.
* Step 18: Measures the state of the coin qubit, which collapses the superposition of states and produces a probability distribution over the lattice.

Relation between high-level steps and code lines:

* Line 6: Applies the Hadamard gate to the coin qubit, setting its state to either 0 or 1 randomly.
* Lines 11 and 15: Perform controlled phase shift operations on the target qubits based on the state of the coin qubit. The phase shift introduces randomness into the walk.
* Line 18: Measures the state of the coin qubit, collapsing the superposition of states and producing a probability distribution over the lattice.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-19
