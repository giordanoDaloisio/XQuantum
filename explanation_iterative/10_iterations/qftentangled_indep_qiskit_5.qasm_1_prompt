Please provide a detailed explanation of the quantum circuit shown above, including a general description of what the algorithm is doing, a high-level description of each step, and a relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code lines. The algorithm appears to be a version of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) with entanglement, which is a widely used quantum algorithm for solving certain problems related to linear algebra and cryptography.

1. General description: The algorithm is a QFT with entanglement, which means it's applying the classical Fourier transform operation to a set of qubits that are entangled in a specific way. This allows for more efficient computation than would be possible with a classical computer.
2. High-level description of each step:
	* `OPENQASM 2.0`: This line indicates that the code is written in OpenQASM version 2.0, which is a language for describing quantum algorithms.
