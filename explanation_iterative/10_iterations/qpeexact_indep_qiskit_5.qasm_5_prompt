Please provide an explanation of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm implemented in the given OpenQASM code, including:

* A general description of what the QPE algorithm is and why it's used.
* A high-level description of each step in the code, including the purpose of each line and the quantum operations being performed.
* A relation between these high-level steps and the relevant code lines, highlighting how they contribute to the overall algorithm.

In your explanation, please include a detailed description of the algorithm's operation, including any important concepts (e.g., superposition, entanglement, etc.) and any key results or insights that can be obtained from the measurements performed in the code. Additionally, please provide examples or analogies to help illustrate the algorithm's behavior and how it differs from classical algorithms.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-18
