6. The line `h q[9];` creates a Hadamard gate on the 9th qubit.
7. The line `cp(pi/2) q[9],q[8];` applies a controlled phase shift of π/2 to the 9th and 8th qubits.
8. The line `h q[8];` creates another Hadamard gate on the 8th qubit.
9. The line `cp(pi/4) q[9],q[7];` applies a controlled phase shift of π/4 to the 9th and 7th qubits.
10. The line `cp(pi/2) q[8],q[7];` applies a controlled phase shift of π/2 to the 8th and 7th qubits.
11. The line `h q[7];` creates another Hadamard gate on the 7th qubit.
