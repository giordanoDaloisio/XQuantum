The quantum circuit shown above simulates the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, a simple quantum algorithm that solves the coin toss problem. The algorithm works by creating an entangled state between two qubits, applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit, and then measuring the state of each qubit in parallel to collapse the quantum state onto one of four possible classical states.

Here's a high-level description of each step in the circuit:

1. `OPENQASM 2.0;`: This line specifies that the code is written in OpenQASM format version 2.0, which is a standardized format for representing quantum circuits.
