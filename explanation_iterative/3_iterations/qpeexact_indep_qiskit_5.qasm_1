The algorithm implemented here is Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which is a quantum algorithm for approximating the ground state energy of a quantum system. The QPE algorithm uses a quantum circuit to evolve a quantum state through a series of controlled phase shifts, followed by a barrier operation that separates the evolution of the qubits from the measurement of the state. The measurement of the state is then repeated multiple times to obtain an estimate of the ground state energy.
