20. `swap q[1],q[3];`: This line swaps the states of the second and third qubits.
21. `barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3],q[4];`: This line applies a barrier to the quantum circuit, which means that the quantum computation halts after running this code.

26. `measure q[4] -> meas[4];`: This line measures the state of the fifth qubit and stores the result in the variable `meas[4]`.

The algorithm implemented by this code is a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) with entanglement. The QFT is a quantum version of the classical Fourier transform, which is used to transform a function from the space of complex numbers to itself. In this case, the entanglement is generated by the controlled-NOT (CX) gates between the qubits.
