This is a quantum circuit written in Qiskit's OPENQASM language, which is a standardized language for describing quantum circuits. The circuit is intended to perform a Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which is a simple quantum algorithm that solves the classical problem of distinguishing between two states with non-trivial entanglement.

Here's a high-level explanation of the code:

1. The first line (`OPENQASM 2.0`) specifies that this is an OPENQASM circuit, and version 2.0 is the latest version supported by Qiskit.
2. The next line (`include "qelib1.inc";`) includes a library file called `qelib1.inc`, which provides various utility functions for working with quantum circuits.
3. The following lines (`qreg q[10]; creg c[9]; u2(0,0) q[0]; u2(0,0) q[1]; h q[2]; u2(0,0) q[3]; h q[4]; u2(0,0) q[5];`) define the quantum registers and classical registers used in the circuit. In this case, there are 10 quantum registers (labelled `q[0]` through `q[9]`) and 9 classical registers (labelled `c[0]` through `c[8]`.
4. The next line (`u2(0,0) q[9];`) defines a qubit register called `q[9]` with a zero-phase shift. This is used to create a Bell state, which is an entangled state that is the input for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
5. The following lines (`cx q[0],q[9]; u2(-pi,-pi) q[0]; cx q[1],q[9]; u2(-pi,-pi) q[1];`) perform a controlled-NOT (CX) gate between the first qubit `q[0]` and the Bell state `q[9]`, followed by a Hadamard gate on the first qubit. This creates two entangled states, one of which is the input for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
6. The next lines (`barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3],q[4],q[5],q[6],q[7],q[8],q[9];`) define a barrier gate that stops the quantum computation from proceeding until all of the qubits are measured.
7. The final lines (`measure q[0] -> c[0]; measure q[1] -> c[1]; measure q[2] -> c[2]; measure q[3] -> c[3]; measure q[4] -> c[4]; measure q[5] -> c[5]; measure q[6] -> c[6]; measure q[7] -> c[7]; measure q[8] -> c[8];`) measure the state of each qubit after the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has been applied, and store the results in classical registers `c[0]` through `c[8]`.

In summary, this quantum circuit implements a Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using 10 qubits, and measures the output states to confirm that the algorithm has worked correctly.
