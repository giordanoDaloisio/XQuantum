Explanation:
The quantum circuit starts by declaring a set of classical registers called `meas` with 5 elements. The next line declares an array of quantum operations called `eval` with 4 elements, each representing a unitary transformation shifted by a different angle (-π, -π/2, -π/4, and -π/8).
The first element of the `eval` array applies a unitary transformation to the first qubit, shifting its phase by 0 radians. The second element applies a unitary transformation to the second qubit, shifting its phase by -π/2 radians. The third element applies a unitary transformation to the third qubit, shifting its phase by -π/4 radians. The fourth element applies a unitary transformation to the fourth qubit, shifting its phase by -π/8 radians.
The quantum circuit then defines a quantum register called `q[0]` with 3 elements, each representing a qubit. The values of the qubits are specified using the `u3()` function, which applies a unitary transformation to the qubits. In this case, the transformation shifts the phase of each qubit by 0.9272952180016122 radians.
The circuit then applies two controlled-NOT (CNOT) operations between the `eval` array and the `q[0]` register, followed by a Hadamard gate on the third element of the `eval` array.
A barrier is then applied to the quantum state, preventing any further evolution of the state. Finally, the circuit measures the first qubit in the `meas[0]` register, and the remaining qubits are measured in their respective registers.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-17
