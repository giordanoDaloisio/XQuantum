The Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm is a quantum computational procedure used to estimate the eigenvalue of a unitary operator. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the qubits in a superposition of states, with each qubit representing a possible phase of the eigenvalue to be estimated.
2. Apply a sequence of controlled phase shift operations to the qubits, where each operation modifies the phases of the qubits by a fixed amount. The number of phase shift operations is chosen such that the final state of the qubits represents a superposition of all possible phases of the eigenvalue.
3. Measure the state of one of the qubits, which collapses the superposition into a classical outcome representing the estimated eigenvalue.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 multiple times, each time applying a different sequence of controlled phase shift operations to the qubits. The final measurement outcomes are used to estimate the eigenvalue of the unitary operator.

In the given quantum circuit code, each line can be described as follows:

1. `q[0] = q[0] + π/4`: This line applies a controlled phase shift operation to the qubit at index 0 (i.e., `q[0]`), where the phase shift is pi/4. This step is part of the overall QPE algorithm, as it helps prepare the initial state of the qubits for the estimation process.
2. `h q[1];`: This line creates a Hadamard gate, which applies the Hadamard transformation to the qubit at index 1 (i.e., `q[1]`). The Hadamard transformation is used in QPE to modulate the phases of the qubits during the estimation process.
3. `h q[2];`: This line creates another Hadamard gate, which applies the Hadamard transformation to the qubit at index 2 (i.e., `q[2]`).
4. `h q[3];`: This line creates yet another Hadamard gate, which applies the Hadamard transformation to the qubit at index 3 (i.e., `q[3]`).
5. `x psi[0];`: This line applies a bit flip operation to the qubit labeled as `psi[0]`. The bit flip operation is used in QPE to transform the initial superposition of states into a new state that represents a projection onto the desired eigenvalue subspace.
6. `cp(-7*π/8) psi[0],q[0];`: This line applies a controlled phase shift operation to the qubits `psi[0]` and `q[0]`. The phase shift is negative 7 times pi/8, which helps modulate the phases of the qubits during the estimation process.
7. `cp(π/4) psi[0],q[1];`: This line applies another controlled phase shift operation to the qubits `psi[0]` and `q[1]`. The phase shift is pi/4, which helps further modulate the phases of the qubits.
8. `cp(π/2) psi[0],q[2];`: This line applies yet another controlled phase shift operation to the qubits `psi[0]` and `q[2]`. The phase shift is pi/2, which helps further modulate the phases of the qubits.
9. `measure q[0];`: This line measures the state of the qubit at index 0 (i.e., `q[0]`) and collapses the superposition of states into a classical outcome representing the estimated eigenvalue.
10. Repeat steps 1-9 multiple times, each time applying a different sequence of controlled phase shift operations to the qubits. The final measurement outcomes are used to estimate the eigenvalue of the unitary operator.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-18
