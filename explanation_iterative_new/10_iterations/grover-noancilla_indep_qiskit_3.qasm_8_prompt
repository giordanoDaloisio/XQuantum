Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that solves the unsorted search problem by amplifying the probability of finding the marked state. The algorithm works by applying a series of quantum operations to a superposition of states, which amplifies the probability of finding the desired solution in the database.

The high-level steps of the algorithm are:

1. Initialize the qubits in a superposition of states. This line initializes the qubits in a linear combination of basis states, where each qubit is in a complex coefficient representing the amplitude of the state.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-19
