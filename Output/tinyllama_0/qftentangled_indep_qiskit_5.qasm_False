This is a high-level explanation of the code:

1. The benchmark consists of 5 quantumRegisters (`q`) and 5 control-registers (`meas`). Each quantumRegister represents an qubit, while each control-register represents a measurement outcome.

2. The program uses the `QELIB1.inc` and `qeblib_1.inc` files to define the quantum register states and readout instructions. The code includes a `h` command (Hadamard gate) for initialization, two `cx` commands to perform entangling gates between qubits 4 and 3, and one `cp` command to swap qubit 0 with qubit 1.

3. To implement the measurement part of the benchmark, the code includes a `measure` command for each qubit (or register). Each `measure` instruction specifies which qubit or register it belongs to and what measurement outcome (0 or 1) is expected. The control-registers are used to represent the final state of all qubits after measurements have been performed.

4. The program also includes a `cp` command for performing a classical "CNOT" gate between control-registers 2 and 1, which can be seen as a measurement outcome (0 or 1) for the qubit that was initially measured in the 2nd register (i.e., qubit 3).

5. The program also includes instructions for barriering (`barrier`) the quantumRegisters before starting the measurements. Barriers are used to ensure that all measurement outcomes are independent and can be compared later.
