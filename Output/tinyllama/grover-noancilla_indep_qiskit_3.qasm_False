This is a Python script that implements the Qiskit Quantum Library's circuit simulator, which is designed to perform quantum circuits and evaluate their outputs. The program takes two input arguments: one for the desired number of qubits (n), and another for the number of measurement bits (m). It then generates a QFT circuit and performs a series of controlled NOT (CNOT) gates on each pair of qubits, followed by a series of CNOT gates between the measurement bits. The output of the program is a list of measured states for each bit in the measurement array, which can be visualized using matplotlib plots.

The program includes two main functions: `init_qobj` and `simulate`. `init_qobj` creates an `Qobj` object, which contains all necessary information for running the circuit simulation, including the initial state of the system (n qubits, m measurement bits), and a list of control qubits (flag qubits) that will be used in the CNOT gates. The `simulate` function uses `qiskit`'s circuit simulator to calculate the output for each bit, storing it in the `meas_state` variable.

The program also includes some helpful comments and error handling for common scenarios. To run the simulation with a specific input (n, m), you would do:

```python
from qiskit import execute, QuantumCircuit, execute

n = 2
m = 3

qc = QuantumCircuit(n, n+1)
cnot_gate = qc.cx(*range(n))
measure_gate = qc.measure(range(n+1), range(1, m+1))

qobj = execute(qc, backend=backend)
result = qobj.result()
meas_state = result.get_counts()
```

Here `backend` is the name of your Qiskit Quantum Processor device/simulator, and we've called `execute` with a circuit, some measurement bits, and a backend to run the program. This should generate output that looks something like this:
