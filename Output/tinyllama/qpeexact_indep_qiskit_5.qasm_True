This high-level explanation summarizes the main components of a quantum algorithm named "Quantum Phase Estimation" as defined in Qiskit's version 1.0.2. The algorithm is designed to solve an optimization problem by optimizing the phase of a state, which can be thought of as the product of all qubits in the state.

The code includes 5 cubits, which are basic building blocks for quantum algorithms. Cubits consist of 3 sub-cubits that represent single qubit operations such as Hadamard and Pauli X rotations. It also has a barrier to simulate classical communication between qubits. The algorithm can be broken down into two parts:

1. Quantum Regularization - this part optimizes the state by adding terms related to phase mismatch. This term is similar to the cost function used in classical optimization algorithms, except it involves an exponential factor instead of a linear one. 2. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) - this part performs a variational quantum eigensolver using a Qiskit's built-in algorithm called VQE.

The code includes several operations to prepare the state for VQE, including barriers that simulate classical communication between qubits, and hamiltonian manipulation that modifies the phase of the state. The final step is to measure all qubits in a particular basis, which determines the optimal phase.

MQT Bench version: 1.1.0 is included in this code as a Qiskit library to provide more information about MQT Bench, including benchmarks for different quantum algorithms.
