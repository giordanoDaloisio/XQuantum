The algorithm performs amplitude estimation by evolving a state $|0\rangle$ to a state $|+\rangle$, which is then measured to obtain an estimate of the absolute value of the complex number $\left| \alpha \right|$. The classical register elements are used to store the intermediate states of the qubit evolution.
