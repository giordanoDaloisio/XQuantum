The quantum circuit is designed to perform a Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) with entanglement. The QFT is a quantum algorithm that transforms a function defined on a lattice into another function that has the same properties as the original function, but is more efficiently computable using quantum computers. In this case, the function being transformed is a classical function represented by the circuit, which is then measured to obtain the final outcome.
