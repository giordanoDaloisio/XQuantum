The Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm is a quantum circuit that applies a series of controlled phase gates to prepare the state for quantum teleportation. The algorithm consists of two main parts: the first part prepares the quantum state by applying a series of controlled phase gates, and the second part applies a series of Hadamard gates to the qubits to perform the Fourier transform.

In this code, the algorithm is implemented using Qiskit's OpenQASM language, which provides a high-level abstraction for programming quantum circuits. The code includes 10 cubits (quantum registers) and 10 measurement outcomes, which are stored in classical registers c[i].
