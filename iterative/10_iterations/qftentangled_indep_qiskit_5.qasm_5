15. `h q[2];`: This line applies a Hadamard gate on the second qubit in the circuit (represented by `q[2]`).
16. `cp(pi/8) q[4],q[1];`: This line applies a controlled phase shift of π/8 to the last 2 qubits in the circuit (represented by `q[4]` and `q[1]`). The control qubit (q[4]) is entangled with the target qubit (q[1]).
17. `cp(pi/4) q[3],q[1];`: This line applies a controlled phase shift of π/4 to the second and first qubits in the circuit (represented by `q[3]` and `q[1]`).
18. `h q[1];`: This line applies a Hadamard gate on the first qubit in the circuit (represented by `q[1]`).
19. `swap q[0],q[4];`: This line swaps the values of the qubits represented by `q[0]` and `q[4]`.
20. `barrier q[0],q[1],q[2],q[3],q[4];`: This line applies a barrier to the circuit, which prevents any further evolution of the qubits after the barrier is applied.
21. `measure q[0] -> meas[0];`: This line measures the state of the first qubit (represented by `q[0]`), and stores the result in the classical register `meas[0]`.
22. `measure q[1] -> meas[1];`: This line measures the state of the second qubit (represented by `q[1]`), and stores the result in the classical register `meas[1]`.
23. `measure q[2] -> meas[2];`: This line measures the state of the third qubit (represented by `q[2]`), and stores the result in the classical register `meas[2]`.
24. `measure q[3] -> meas[3];`: This line measures the state of the fourth qubit (represented by `q[3]`), and stores the result in the classical register `meas[3]`.
25. `measure q[4] -> meas[4];`: This line measures the state of the fifth qubit (represented by `q[4]`), and stores the result in the classical register `meas[4]`.

The name of the algorithm is "Quantum Fourier Transform with entanglement", which refers to the fact that the circuit applies a controlled-NOT gate between the last 2 qubits, creating an entangled state. This allows for a more efficient computation of the quantum Fourier transform.
