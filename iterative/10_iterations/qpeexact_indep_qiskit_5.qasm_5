The algorithm implemented in this code is Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which is a quantum algorithm for approximating the ground state energy of a quantum system. The QPE algorithm uses a sequence of controlled phase shifts to evolve the quantum state into a superposition of states with different phases, and then measures the first qubit of the register to obtain an estimate of the ground state energy.

The code includes 5 cubits (quantum operations) and 1 classical register (psi). The cubits are used to implement the controlled phase shifts, and the classical register is used to store the outcome of the measurement.
