This code is written in OpenQASM 2.0 and is performing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The algorithm is designed to solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem which is a problem in computer science and mathematics. 

The code starts by including the necessary library "qelib1.inc" and declaring a quantum register "q" with 10 qubits and a classical register "c" with 9 bits.

The code then applies various quantum gates and measurements to the qubits. The gates used include the Hadamard gate (h) and the u2 gate (a general single-qubit gate with two parameters). The code also applies controlled-not (cx) gates to perform controlled operations.

After applying the gates and measurements, a barrier is placed to ensure that all operations have completed before proceeding. The measurements of the qubits are then stored in the classical register "c".

In summary, the code is implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using 10 qubits and performing various quantum gates and measurements to solve a specific problem.
