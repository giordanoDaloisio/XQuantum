This C++ program uses the Qiskit Quantum Library to simulate a quantum algorithm, called the Deutsch-Joźszak algorithm, on a set of 10 qubits. The algorithm involves performing a series of controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates and then measuring the output states of each qubit. The final measurement results are stored in a list of measured amplitudes (c[i]) for each qubit (i).

The benchmark code has been created by MQT Bench, a Python library that provides tools to optimize and compare quantum circuits based on various parameters, including circuit depth, circuit size, and time complexity. The code uses the Qiskit Quantum Library, which is an open-source software for developing and simulating quantum algorithms using a quantum computer.

To run the benchmark code, we need to compile and install the necessary libraries. Compiling C++ projects in Linux is usually done with the "make" command:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j$(nproc)
```

This command builds the project and sets up the environment for compiling and executing the benchmark code. In order to run the benchmark, we need to install the Qiskit Quantum Library:

```sh
pip3 install qiskit
```

Once the installation is complete, we can run the benchmark code by calling the "qiskit_benchmark" function from the Python library. For example:

```python
import qiskit_benchmark as bm
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute
from qiskit.circuit.library import DeutschJozefAlgorithm

# compile and run quantum circuit using Qiskit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 10)
circuit.h(range(len(circuit.qubits)))
circuit.barrier()
circuit.append(DeutschJozefAlgorithm())
execute(circuit, backend=backend).result().get_data()
```

In this example, we've used the "QuantumCircuit" class to create a 2-qubit Deutsch-Joźszak quantum circuit and called the "execute" method of the Qiskit library to execute it on the backend. The result will be stored in the `data` variable that is passed into the function as an argument. The data returned from the function has the following format:

```python
<list: list[array(int, 1d)]>
```

This means that the benchmark code returns a list of measured amplitudes (c[i]) for each qubit in the input circuit. We can then use this list to plot and analyze the results of our quantum algorithm using any plotting or analysis tool of choice.
