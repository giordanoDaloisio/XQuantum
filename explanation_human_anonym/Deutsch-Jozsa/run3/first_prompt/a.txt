This code is a simple quantum circuit to demonstrate the basic operations of two qubits, controlled-not (CN) gates and quantum entanglement. It simulates an implementation using the Qiskit quantum library on an IBM Quantum Experience device.

The circuit comprises two qubits (`q[0]` and `q[1]`) with six control qubits (`c[0]` to `c[6]`), all initialized to zero states. The CN gate is used for controlling one of the qubits, while the entanglement between them is demonstrated using the quantum state `c[0] * c[1]`.

The circuit consists of two sets of gates: u2 gates to perform Pauli X rotation (rotation of each qubit around its respective axis) and CN gates. The CN gate can be used to entangle two qubits by applying the controlled-NOT (`CN`) operation with respect to the first qubit, followed by a Hadamard (`H`) gate on the second qubit.

The circuit simulates this process using an array of entangled qubits and a network of control-qubit-target (CQT) gates. The resulting quantum state can be measured in order to extract the entanglement and perform operations on the two qubits involved.

To run the circuit, you need to compile it with `qiskit` and then execute it using `qobj`. The circuit will take a few seconds to simulate depending on the size of your system.
