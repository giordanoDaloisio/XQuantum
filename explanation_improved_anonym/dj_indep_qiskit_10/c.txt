Certainly! Here's an improved explanation that is more complete yet simple:

The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm determines if an unknown oracle function maps input values to either 0 or 1 in a way that is either constant (always outputs 0 or always outputs 1) or balanced (outputs 0 and 1 equally often).

Here's the corresponding quantum code:

Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The qubits are initialized. The gates `u2` and `h` are applied to set up the input state and put the system into superposition.
2. **Oracle Interaction**: The `cx` (CNOT) gates and `u2` gates implement the oracle function. The oracle processes the input qubits based on its predefined logic.
3. **Interference**: More `h` gates are applied to create interference patterns that will reveal the nature of the oracle.
4. **Measurement**: Finally, the qubits are measured. The results indicate whether the oracle is constant or balanced.

If all measured bits are 0, the function is constant. If any bit is 1, the function is balanced.
