Here's a high-level explanation of the MQT Bench code for performing the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) on a 10-cubit grid. The code is written in Qiskit Verilog and runs on a qiskit simulator. It includes a barrier between qubits, which helps prevent quantum entanglement during the computation. The program also uses the `incrule` instruction to perform a Hadamard gate over each qubit. The code benchmarked by MQT Bench version 1.1.0 on Qiskit version 1.0.2 and with 10-cubit grid dimensions.
