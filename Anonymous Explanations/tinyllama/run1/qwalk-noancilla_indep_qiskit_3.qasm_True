This high-level explanation covers the general structure and functionality of a quantum algorithm, which in this case is a quantum walk. The quantum walk is a specialized quantum circuit designed to solve a particular problem using quantum mechanics. The code for this algorithm includes 3 cubits, or qubits, that are used to represent various states in the physical world.

The basic idea behind quantum walks is to use the interference of quantum systems to achieve certain goals. In this case, the goal is to compute a function using the quantum walk, which involves performing an operation on the state of a set of qubits in a particular way to obtain a desired output. The code for this algorithm includes specific operations for each step of the computation, such as creating qubits, applying gates, and measuring results.

The high-level explanation also explains how the algorithm uses quantum mechanics to solve certain problems in quantum computing, including the function that is being computed. It's important to note that this code is not entirely executable because it only provides a general overview of the algorithm, but it does illustrate the basic steps involved and how they work together to achieve the desired output.
