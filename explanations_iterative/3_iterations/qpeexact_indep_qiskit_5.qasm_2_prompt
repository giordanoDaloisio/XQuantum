Could you provide a line-by-line explanation of how the quantum phase estimation algorithm works in this code, including a detailed discussion of the following:

* The role of each gate (e.g., Hadamard gate, controlled phase shift gate) and how it contributes to the overall process of estimating the eigenvalues of the unitary operator.
* Any key concepts or techniques used in the algorithm that are not immediately apparent from a high-level examination of the code, such as entanglement, superposition, or quantum parallelism.
* The trade-offs involved in designing the algorithm (e.g., between the number of qubits used and the accuracy of the estimation).// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-18
