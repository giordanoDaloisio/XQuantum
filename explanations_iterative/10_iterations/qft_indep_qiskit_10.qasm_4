The QFT algorithm is a widely used quantum algorithm in cryptography and other fields, which is why it's included in this code. The algorithm takes as input a set of complex numbers representing the coefficients of the Fourier transform, and applies a series of controlled phase gates to the qubits to perform the transform. The resulting classical register contains the results of the measurement.
