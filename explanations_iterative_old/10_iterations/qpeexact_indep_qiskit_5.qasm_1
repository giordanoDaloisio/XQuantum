The Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is a quantum version of the classical phase estimation algorithm, which is used to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. In this case, the algorithm is used to estimate the eigenvalues of the Hadamard gate, which is a fundamental operation in quantum computing. The algorithm works by iteratively applying the Hadamard gate to a fixed number of qubits, measuring the resulting state at each iteration, and using the measurement outcomes to compute the eigenvalues of the Hadamard gate.
