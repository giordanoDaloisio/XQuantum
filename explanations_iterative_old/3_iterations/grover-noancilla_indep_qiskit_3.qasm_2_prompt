Explain in detail how Grover's algorithm works, using this specific quantum circuit as an example. Please include a thorough explanation of each gate and operation, as well as how they are used to search for the target qubit. Discuss any important aspects of the algorithm's implementation, such as the choice of initial state, the number of iterations, and the role of the barrier gate. Finally, explain how Grover's algorithm can provide an exponential speedup over classical algorithms for solving the unstructured search problem.// Benchmark was created by MQT Bench on 2024-03-19
