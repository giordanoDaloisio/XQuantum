This is a quantum circuit written in Qiskit's OPENQASM2.0 language. It implements the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which is a simple quantum algorithm that can be used to solve the quantum version of the majority vote problem. The algorithm takes 10 qubits as input and produces a single bit output indicating whether the majority of the inputs are 0 or 1.

The quantum circuit is designed to implement a controlled-NOT gate between each pair of qubits, followed by a Hadamard gate on each qubit. The barrier operation is used to freeze the state of the qubits at the end of the circuit, and the measurement is performed on each qubit to obtain the final state.
