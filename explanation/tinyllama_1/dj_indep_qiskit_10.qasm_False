This is a basic benchmark in the Qiskit library, which simulates a circuit of 10 qubits and performs the operations represented by the circuits below. The benchmark was created on the MQT Bench code version 1.1.0, with Qiskit version 1.0.2.

The benchmark consists of three circuits:
- u2(0,0) q[0] performs Hadamard gates to create a single-qubit control register and entangles the control qubit with the target qubits.
- u2(0,0) q[1] performs the same operation, but on a different qubit than q[0]. This is known as a local circuit in Qiskit.
- h q[2] performs a Hadamard gate to flip the state of each qubit.
- cx q[0],q[9] performs the controlled NOT (CNOT) operation on the control and target qubits, followed by an Hadamard gate. This is known as a two-qubit circuit in Qiskit.
- u2(-pi,-pi) q[9] performs a single-qubit rotation by pi radians clockwise around the z-axis.

The benchmark then measures all of these operations on a 10-qubit system, and uses the results to calculate the time taken for each operation. The benchmark consists of three sets of 3 circuits:
- set 1: u2(0,0) q[0], h q[2], cx q[0],q[9]
- set 2: u2(-pi,-pi) q[5], h q[4], cx q[0],q[9]
- set 3: u2(-pi,-pi) q[8], h q[6], cx q[0],q[9]

The benchmark measures the time taken for each circuit in a single run, and plots the results as a graph. The time for each operation is measured using the `timing` method in Qiskit's `quantumcircuit` class.
