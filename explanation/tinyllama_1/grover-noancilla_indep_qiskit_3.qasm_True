This is a high-level overview of the benchmark code for the Grover algorithm, also known as the search problem in quantum information science. It includes 3 cubits of code that can be executed on various quantum computers and perform the classical time-complexity-preserving search algorithm for searching for a given integer in a set of integers using Grover's algorithm. The benchmark was created by MQT Bench on March 19, 2024, and includes information about the Qiskit version and MQT Bench version used to execute it. This code is part of a larger set of benchmark codes for quantum algorithms in Qiskit, an open-source library for quantum computing developed by IBM Research.
