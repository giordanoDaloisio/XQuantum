Here's a high-level explanation of this quantum algorithm, Quantum Fourier Transform with entanglement (MQT Bench):

1. The program includes five qubits (quantum bits) named q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3], and q[4]. These qubits are initialized to random values in the range -pi/8 to pi/8 (inclusive).

2. The MQT Bench algorithm consists of several steps, including:

   a) Hitting each qubit with a phase shift by setting its state to π/4 (or -π/4) and measuring its state again. This process is repeated for all qubits.

   b) Using the measured states as input for a quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithm, which involves finding the unique value of each bit in a given pattern (e.g., 0011... or 1011...).

3. The QFT algorithm is based on the fact that the quantum Fourier transform can be viewed as a classical algorithm (i.e., a one-dimensional search) that applies only to certain patterns of bits.

4. By applying a particular pattern to all five qubits at once, each bit value is mapped to a unique quantum state, which is then measured and processed in the same way as before (step a). 

5. The resulting measurement values are added together (step b) to form the final output.

6. The QFT algorithm is an approximate one-dimensional search that only covers certain patterns of bits. However, by using entanglement, the algorithm is transformed into a more efficient two-dimensional search that can be applied on larger quantum systems. 

7. In this case, the MQT Bench program uses the QFT algorithm to find all possible permutations (i.e., patterns) of five bits in a given pattern. The resulting output values are then added together to form the final output.
