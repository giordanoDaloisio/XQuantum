The benchmark code is a quantum simulator that generates a quantum circuit, consisting of up to 5 qubits, for solving a classical problem in less time. The circuit consists of a variety of gates, such as controlled-NOT (CNOT) and controlled-phase (CP), which are used to implement transformations on the qubits.

The benchmark code has been designed by MQT Bench on 2024-03-17 using Qiskit version 1.0.2. The Qiskit version used in this code corresponds to Qiskit 1.0.2.

The benchmark code uses various qubit registers, which are initialized with random values before being passed through the quantum circuit. These initial states can be controlled by gates, such as CNOTs and CPs, which transform the initial state into a more suitable starting point for the actual calculation.

The goal of this code is to optimize the quantum circuit for solving a classical problem in less time. This optimization process involves measuring the output qubits of the circuit after each gate, and analyzing the results to determine whether to apply another gate or if the circuit has reached its optimal solution.
