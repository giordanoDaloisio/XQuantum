This code is implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm with entanglement. The code includes 5 qubits represented by the qreg and creg variables. The algorithm involves applying a series of Hadamard gates (represented by the h command) and controlled-Not gates (represented by the cx command) to entangle and manipulate the qubits. The algorithm also includes phase gates (represented by the cp command) to introduce phase shifts at various points. Finally, the algorithm uses the swap command to swap the qubits in positions 0 and 4, and positions 1 and 3. After all the operations, the code includes measures to read out the final state of each qubit and store the results in the meas array.
