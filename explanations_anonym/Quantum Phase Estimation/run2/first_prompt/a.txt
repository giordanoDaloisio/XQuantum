This is a high-level overview of the code for the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The algorithm consists of five cubits, which are comprised of two lines:
1. OpenQASM 2.0 - This is the Qiskit API that generates the circuit from a given problem and specification. It includes various functions to manipulate qubits (quantum bits), gates (operations performed on qubits), and measurement (intrinsically part of quantum computing).
2. Include "qeliab1.inc"; - This is an intermediate file included with Qiskit, which defines the set of quantum operations required for this specific problem. It specifies how to implement the phase estimation algorithm given a certain set of initial conditions (the circuit we are executing).
3. Quantum Regular Expression - This is used to define and execute specific gates that are used in the phase estimation process.
4. HQubits q[4] - These qubits represent the state after applying the circuit specified by the "quantum regular expression".
5. Psibox ps[1]; - These qubits represent the intermediate states during the measurement process, which can be used to determine the outcome of each measurement (0 or 1).

The algorithm consists of four steps:
1. Quantum Phase Estimation: This step involves executing the circuit with random initial conditions until a certain set of measurements is made. The final state of each qubit is then determined by measuring them in their respective eigenstates.
2. Measurements: These are performed on each qubit after the final state is calculated, and the results are stored in the "c" register (qubits 0-3).
3. Barrier: This step is performed at the beginning of the algorithm to ensure that all measurements and subsequent operations happen within the given time window (e.g., 1 ps).
4. Final Results: These are obtained by measuring each qubit separately, and then performing a final check on the results to ensure accuracy.

Note that there is no need for any intermediate files or libraries provided by Qiskit in this code since it includes its own implementation of quantum gates.
