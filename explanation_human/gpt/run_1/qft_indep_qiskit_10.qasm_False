This code is written in the OpenQASM language and specifies a quantum circuit. 

The code begins by including the necessary library "qelib1.inc" which contains predefined quantum gates like the Hadamard gate (H) and controlled-phase gate (CP). 

The code defines a quantum register `q` with 10 qubits and a classical register `c` with 10 bits. It also defines another classical register `meas` with 10 bits for storing measurement results. 

The code then applies a series of quantum gates and measurements to the qubits. It applies Hadamard gates (`h`) to qubits 9 to 0. It applies controlled-phase gates (`cp`) with varying angles to pairs of qubits. 

After the gates, the code performs a series of swaps (`swap`) between pairs of qubits. 

Finally, a barrier is inserted to ensure all gates have finished before performing measurements. The code then measures each qubit and stores the results in the `meas` register.
