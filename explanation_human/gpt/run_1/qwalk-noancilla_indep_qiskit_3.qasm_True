This code is implementing a quantum walk algorithm. 

The code starts by initializing two quantum registers, `node` and `coin`, and a classical register `meas`. 

Next, the algorithm applies a Hadamard gate (H gate) to the `coin[0]` qubit, followed by a controlled-controlled-X gate (CCX gate) between `coin[0]` and `node[1]`, and a controlled-X gate (CX gate) between `coin[0]` and `node[1]`. 

Then, the code applies an X gate to `node[1]` and `coin[0]`, followed by another CCX gate, CX gate, X gate, and CCX gate sequence. This sequence is repeated four times, with the addition of a U2 gate (a parametric two-pulse single-qubit gate) applied to `coin[0]` on the third and seventh repetition. 

Finally, the code adds a barrier to synchronize the qubits, and measures the states of `node[0]`, `node[1]`, and `coin[0]`, storing the measurement results in the `meas` classical register. 

Overall, this code is implementing a quantum walk algorithm using three qubits.
