This code is written in the OpenQASM programming language, which is used for creating quantum circuits. 

The code starts by including the necessary libraries, specifically "qelib1.inc" which provides commonly used quantum gates.

Next, it declares two quantum registers: q[4] and psi[1], and one classical register c[4]. The q[4] register consists of 4 qubits, while psi[1] register consists of 1 qubit.

The next few lines apply Hadamard (H) gates to qubits q[0], q[1], q[2], and q[3]. These gates put the qubits into a superposition of states.

Then, an X gate is applied to the psi[0] qubit, followed by controlled-phase (CP) gates applied to qubits q[0], q[1], and q[2] with psi[0] as the control qubit.

A SWAP gate is then applied between qubits q[1] and q[2].

Another CP gate is applied to qubit q[3] with psi[0] as the control qubit.

Next, a SWAP gate is applied between qubits q[0] and q[3].

The code then applies Hadamard (H) gate to q[0], followed by CP and H gates applied to qubits q[1] and q[2] with q[0] as the control qubit.

More CP and H gates are applied to qubit q[3] with q[0], q[1], and q[2] as the control qubits.

A barrier is then added to separate different parts of the circuit.

Finally, measurements are performed on qubits q[0], q[1], q[2], and q[3], and the results are stored in classical bits c[0], c[1], c[2], and c[3] respectively.
