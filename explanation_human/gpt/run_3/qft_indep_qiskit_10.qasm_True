This code implements the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm. The algorithm uses 10 qubits (labeled q[0] to q[9]) to perform a series of Hadamard and controlled phase gates to transform a quantum state into its frequency components. 

The code starts by importing the necessary Qiskit library and defining the quantum and classical registers. 

Next, a series of Hadamard gates are applied to the q[9] to q[0] qubits. Then, a series of controlled phase gates are applied to create the controlled rotations necessary for the Fourier Transform. 

After that, additional Hadamard gates are applied to the qubits. 

The qubits are then measured and the measurement results are stored in the classical register meas[0] to meas[9].
