The algorithm performs a quantum phase estimation, which is a quantum version of the classical Phase Estimation algorithm. The algorithm starts by applying a series of controlled phase shifts to the qubits, followed by a barrier operation that freezes the computation and allows for measurement of the qubits. The algorithm then measures the qubits and outputs the results in the classical registers.

The name of the algorithm is "Quantum Phase Estimation".
