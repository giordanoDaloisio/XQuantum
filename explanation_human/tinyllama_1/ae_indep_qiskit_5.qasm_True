Here's a high-level explanation of this Qiskit code for an amplitude estimation algorithm with 5 cubits:

1. The code includes 5 qubits, or logical states, called "q" (pronounced "qubit"). A qubit is a quantum state that can be in one of two possible states at the same time (up to a local basis swap).

2. The program first initializes the qubits using the QE class, which creates a new QE object and sets its initialization values. This is done before executing any operations on the qubits.

3. Next, the program defines an oracle, which is a quantum circuit that performs a specific measurement or query on one or more qubits. In this case, we are asking if a qubit is in state 1 (up), or 0 (down). The oracle circuit is implemented using a "H" (Hadamard) gate, followed by the corresponding Hadamard flip operator to swap qubits.

4. To perform amplitude estimation, the program performs two operations: measurement and readout. A measurement circuit measures each qubit in one of the allowed states, while a readout circuit checks whether or not a specific qubit is measured.

5. The "measure" operation measures each qubit in its initial state (up to a local basis swap). In this case, we're measuring each qubit with the Hadamard gate (H), followed by a Hadamard flip (F) operator to swap qubits.

6. After measurement and readout, the program outputs the amplitudes of the measured states. This can be done using an amplifier circuit that multiplies the amplitudes of all measured states together.

7. The output amplitudes are then used to determine whether or not the specified query was answered correctly. This is done by checking if a certain threshold (usually 95%) is reached. If the threshold is reached, the algorithm is considered successful; otherwise, it's considered failed.

8. Finally, the program performs the final step of printing out the final amplitudes and thresholds, along with the number of times the query was answered correctly (or incorrectly).
