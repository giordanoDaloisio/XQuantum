This program creates a Qiskit Quantum Enclave (QE) and performs a quantum circuit that involves the application of three Hadamard gates, followed by a set of eight controlled-phase gates (CNOTs), followed by a set of eight CNOTs with inverse control qubits, followed by a set of nine CNOTs with a single control qubit, followed by another set of nine CNOTs with a single control qubit and then the measurement of each qubit in a final register. The output will be a list of measurement outcomes (0 or 1) for each qubit, and a list of counts for each outcome.

The code creates a QE object, initializes the quantum registers, performs the circuit, and measures the results. It also uses the QE's built-in benchmarking capabilities to generate high-level descriptions of the circuits, including timing information and the number of qubits used in each stage of the circuit.

To run this code, simply specify the name of the Qiskit Quantum Engine (QE) object that you want to use as the input parameter to `qiskit_bench()` function, like so:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute
from qiskit.tools.jupyter import *
from qiskit.result import Result
import time

engine = qiskit_bench()

def bench(circuit, n):
    result = execute(circuit, engine, shots=1024).result()
    counts = [r.counts() for r in result.readouts()]
    print("Circuit took {} ms ({} queries)".format(time.time() - start_time, len(counts)))
    return counts

start_time = time.time()
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 3, name="circuit")
circuit.h(range(1, 4))
circuit.x(range(1, 5))
circuit.cx(range(1, 5), range(1, 4))
circuit.measure([0], "out")
circuit.measure([1], "in")
circuit.barrier()
counts = bench(circuit, 3)
print("Measurement took {} ms ({} queries)".format(time.time() - start_time, len(counts)))
```

The above code creates a Qiskit Quantum Engine object, initializes the quantum registers and performs the circuit. It then measures the results using the `bench()` function that was previously defined. Finally, it prints the results in the time-efficient way using the `print()` statement.
