This code is a simplified version of the benchmark described in the text material, which consists of 4 qubits (node and coin) connected to one register (node). The program performs quantum operations using Qiskit's QuantumCircuit class, which creates circuits from gate definitions.

In this example, we use MQT Bench version 1.1.0 to measure the output of the program. We can modify the code below with additional information such as input data or parameters for the benchmark to run. For example, we could use MQT Bench version 1.0.2 and set the Qubit and Register names to match the ones used in the text material.

To execute the program using Qiskit's QuantumCircuit class, we can call the `run` method on the `Measured` object returned from the `execute` method of a QuantumCircuit instance:
```python
from qiskit import execute, IBMQ

quantum_instance = IBMQ.get_provider(config={"qubit_ops": "gates"}).acquire()
qr = quantum_instance.create_circuit(name="test")
qr.h(node)
for i in range(2):
    qr.ccx(*range(i), *range(i+1))
qr.measure(node, meas[0])
result = execute(qr, name="test", shots=100).result()
out = result.get_data()
```
This code sets the quantum instance to use Qubit and Register names from the text material, and calls the `run` method with a QuantumCircuit object for the program. The `measure` method is used to measure the output of the circuit using the `meas[0]` register. The result is then extracted from the `result.get_data()` method.
