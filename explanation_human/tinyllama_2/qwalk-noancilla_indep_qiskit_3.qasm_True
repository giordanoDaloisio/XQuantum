This is a high-level explanation of the code you provided:

Openspecification: OpenQASM 2.0
Includes library qeasy (for qubit initialization and entanglement) and QEasy 1.1.0
Uses quantum engine Qiskit version 1.0.2

The program is divided into two main parts: compiling and running the algorithm. The compiling part includes generating a quantum circuit from the given specifications, while the running part uses the compiled circuit to perform the desired task on a qubit register.

Compiling the circuit:
- Generate the circuit using the qeasy library for qubit initialization and entanglement
- Translate the generated circuit into Qiskit's language (qasm)
- Compile the Qiskit program into a quantum computing engine executable

Running the algorithm:
- Run the compiled Qiskit program with the desired parameters in the input file (usually qobj file or tvmqc.json format, which is a standard for qubit registers used in Qiskit)

The name of the algorithm is "Quantum walk", which is a specific quantum algorithm based on the concept of quantum walk, where each step involves performing some unitary transformation and then taking two qubits as input and outputting them to another qubit. The algorithm can be further broken down into sub-steps with a clear purpose or task. 

The program includes 3 cubits in its compilation, which are used to perform quantum operations on qubits, such as the Quantum walk algorithm.
