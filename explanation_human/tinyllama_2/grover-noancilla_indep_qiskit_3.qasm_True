This high-level explanation is based on the Qiskit version 1.0.2 and the MQT Bench algorithm "Grover" for quantum search. The "Grover" algorithm involves the use of a quantum search algorithm named Grover's Algorithm, which is optimized to find a state in a large Hilbert space that satisfies certain conditions (such as finding a single eigenvector or finding a minimum distance from a given vector). In this specific implementation, there are three cubits involved:
- A quantum register called "q" for storing the search parameters (e.g., the number of queries to be made) and the target state to be searched for. - A quantum register called "flag" to denote if the state is known to be present or not. - A quantum register called "meas" to measure qubits. The algorithm's main operation involves constructing the search space by applying a series of logical gates on the q and flag registers, while performing certain measurements on the meas registers to determine whether the target state has been found or not. This is achieved through the use of quantum search algorithms optimized for Grover's Algorithm. The MQT Bench version: 1.1.0 is used in this Qiskit implementation, which can be downloaded from the CDA.cit.tum.de website.
