The Quantum Fourier Transform is a quantum algorithm used for solving certain discrete logarithm problems. It involves applying controlled phase shifts to a series of qubits, followed by measurements of the resulting states. The algorithm repeats this process multiple times, with the number of repetitions depending on the specific problem being solved.

In summary, this code implements the Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm using Qiskit, with 10 cubits in total.
